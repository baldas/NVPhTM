 *  Here we define the static adaptivity policies.  These do not use
 *  profiles, so they are very simple.
 *
 *  NB: these are interesting from a historical perspective, in that they
 *      were part of [Spear SPAA 2011].  However, subsequent work has shown
 *      that adapting on the basis of pathology avoidance (e.g., consecutive
 *      aborts) is not a good strategy on its own, because of the possibility
 *      of Toxic Transactions [Liu Transact 2011].
