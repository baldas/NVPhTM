/**
 *  In order to get allocation and deallocation to work correctly inside of a
 *  speculative transactional region, we need to be sure that a doomed
 *  transaction cannot access memory that has been returned to the OS.
 *
 *  WBMMPolicy is RSTM's variant of epoch-based reclamation.  It is similar
 *  to proposals by [Fraser PhD 2003] and [Hudson ISMM 2006].
 *
 *  Note that this file has real code in it, and that code gets inlined into
 *  many places.  It's not pretty, and we may eventually want to reduce the
 *  footprint of this file on the rest of the project.
