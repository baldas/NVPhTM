/**
 *  We use the ValueList class to log address/value pairs for our
 *  value-based-validation implementations---NOrec and NOrecPrio currently. We
 *  generally log things at word granularity, and during validation we check to
 *  see if any of the bits in the word has changed since the word was originally
 *  read. If they have, then we have a conflict.
 *
 *  This word-granularity continues to be correct when we have enabled byte
 *  logging (because we're building for C++ TM compatibility), but it introduces
 *  the possibility of byte-level false conflicts. One of VBV's advantages is
 *  that there are no false conflicts. In order to preserve this behavior, we
 *  offer the user the option to use the byte-mask (which is already enabled for
 *  byte logging) to do byte-granularity validation. The disadvantage to this
 *  technique is that the read log entry size is increased by the size of the
 *  stored mask (we could optimize for 64-bit Linux and pack the mask into an
 *  unused part of the logged address, but we don't yet have this capability).
 *
 *  This file implements the value log given the current configuration settings
 *  in stm/config.h

       *  We believe that this implementation is safe because the logged address
       *  is *always* word aligned, thus promoting subword loads to aligned word
       *  loads followed by a masking operation will not cause any undesired HW
       *  behavior (page fault, etc.).

       *  We're also assuming that the masking operation means that any
       *  potential "low-level" race that we introduce is immaterial---this may
       *  or may not be safe in C++1X. As an example, someone is
       *  nontransactionally writing the first byte of a word and we're
       *  transactionally reading the scond byte. There is no language-level
       *  race, however when we promote the transactional byte read to a word,
       *  we read the same location the nontransactional access is writing, and
       *  there is no intervening synchronization. We're safe from some bad
       *  behavior because of the atomicity of word-level accesses, and we mask
       *  out the first byte, which means the racing read was actually
       *  dead. There are no executions where the source program can observe the
       *  race and thus they conclude that it is race-free.
       *
       *  I don't know if this argument is valid, but it is certainly valid for
       *  now, since there is no memory model for C/C++.
       *
       *  If this becomes a problem we can switch to a loop-when-mask != ~0x0
       *  approach.
